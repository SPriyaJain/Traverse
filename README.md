# Traverse
A game made with Javascript and the Phaser framework. You can play the game [here](https://spriyajain.github.io/traverse/).

***

Traverse is a 2D browser game using JavaScript and Phaser.JS that continuously generates random gameplay. The user attempts to remain oriented while navigating an unorthodox path, as the speed of the path traversal increases. All artwork is original.

Creating Traverse was a challenge in that Phaser.JS, the game engine, relies heavily on its community for documentation and troubleshooting. However, I learned to experiment and quickly learn new technologies through this process.
